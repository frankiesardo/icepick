Icepick
============

Icepick is an Android library that simplifies the lifecycle of save and restore instance state.
It uses annotation processing to generate code that does bundle manipulation and key generation, removing lots of boilerplate from your classes.

```java
class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @Icicle String username; // This will be automatically saved and restored

  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    Icepick.restoreInstanceState(this, savedInstanceState);
  }

  @Override public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    Icepick.saveInstanceState(this, outState);
  }

  // You can put the calls to Bundles into a BaseActivity
  // All Activities extending BaseActivity automatically have state saved/restored
}
```

Icepick can also generate the instance state code for your Custom Views:

```java
class CustomView extends View {
  @Icicle int selectedPosition; // This will be automatically saved and restored

  @Override public Parcelable onSaveInstanceState() {
    return Icepick.saveInstanceState(this, super.onSaveInstanceState());
  }

  @Override public void onRestoreInstanceState(Parcelable state) {
    super.onRestoreInstanceState(Icepick.restoreInstanceState(this, state));
  }

  // You can put the calls to Bundles into a BaseCustomView and inherit from it
  // All Views extending this CustomView automatically have state saved/restored
}
```

Null-safety
--------

All variables, annotated with `@Icicle`, annotation are assumed to be null-safe; generated code does not
contain null checks, the only exception being wrappers for primitive types (`Long`, `Character` etc.)
This behavior can be modified in both ways by annotating corresponding variable definitions with
any `Nullable`/`Nonnull`/`NotNull` annotation of your choise.

Note: Icepick does no checks for null-safety on it's own. You still have to use other tools with
abovementioned annotations to detect related issues.

Proguard
--------

If Proguard is enabled be sure to add these rules on your configuration:

```
-dontwarn icepick.**
-keep class **$$Icicle { *; }
-keepnames class * { @icepick.Icicle *;}
```

Download
--------

Icepick comes in two libraries: `icepick` and `icepick-processor`.

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.frankiesardo:icepick:2.3.6'
  provided 'com.github.frankiesardo:icepick-processor:2.3.6'
}
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.frankiesardo</groupId>
    <artifactId>icepick</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.6</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.frankiesardo</groupId>
    <artifactId>icepick-processor</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.6</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Jar:

This is the [library](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/frankiesardo/icepick/2.3.6/icepick-2.3.6.jar) and here is the [processor](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/frankiesardo/icepick-processor/2.3.6/icepick-processor-2.3.6.jar). Note that if you use include the jars without using a dependency management tool you'll also need to include Guava in your path.
